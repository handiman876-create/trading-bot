# Backlog

Deferred work and known limitations that are observed but not actively
prioritized. Each entry: what was seen, where, and the proposed direction.

## A/B tracker: option IV needs an entitled Polygon key

**Observed (2026-07-19):** `screen_ab_tracker.py` records `avg_iv` per screen via
`polygon_client.get_atm_option_iv()`, which reads `/v3/snapshot/options/{symbol}`.
On the current free/shared Polygon key that endpoint returns **HTTP 403
`NOT_AUTHORIZED`** ("You are not entitled to this data"). The fetch catches this,
logs a WARNING, and returns `None`, so every pick is still recorded and the
2-week return comparison is unaffected — but `avg_iv` will read `None` for the
whole experiment. Realized volatility (`avg_rv`) is recorded alongside as the
premium proxy and answers the volatility question meaningfully in the meantime.

**Direction:** No code change needed — the IV path is already correct. When an
options-entitled Polygon key is available, set `POLYGON_API_KEY` to it (or point
the tracker at a separate entitled key) and `avg_iv` populates automatically.
Polygon's Options Starter (~$29/mo) is the cheapest tier that returns the
snapshot's `implied_volatility`/greeks. Revisit if/when the A/B result argues that
true IV (not just realized vol) is decision-relevant.

## reconcile_stops(): re-arm existing positions on a significant regime change

**Observed (2026-07-23):** Pre-2026-07-18 positions carry no `atr_mult` and fall
back to 2.5x (risk_on width) for their whole life; by design, an existing stop is
never re-widened/re-tightened when the regime shifts — only NEW entries feel it
(config.py:139-146). Idea: on a material regime change, run a reconcile pass that
re-derives `atr_mult` for open positions from the current regime x ATR band.

**IMPORTANT — vet these two traps before building (both surfaced while scoping
DDOG on 2026-07-23):**
1. **Which price feeds the band?** The shipped rule bands on **ATR/price AT
   ENTRY** (`_get_atr_mult`, strategy.py:396). Re-deriving on *current* price is a
   different, unbuilt rule. Example: DDOG is 4.98% (normal, 2.5x) at entry but
   5.19% (high, 1.5x) at today's lower price. Current-price banding **tightens the
   stop precisely because the position fell** — the more a long loses, the harder
   it yanks the stop toward market, stopping out near local lows. Backwards for a
   trailing stop. If we reconcile, band on entry price, not spot.
2. **Never arm a stop through the market.** A re-tightened long stop can land
   ABOVE current price (DDOG's 1.5x figure was $254.37 vs $244.40 spot = instant
   sell). Any reconcile MUST clamp: never place a stop above spot (long) / below
   spot (short) — else "better protection" becomes an immediate realized loss.

**Note:** the motivating "$2,473 better on DDOG" figure was a mirage — it combined
both traps (current-price banding + a stop above market). Entry-band reconcile on
DDOG today yields 2.5x = no change. The genuine goal behind it ("winners stop
giving back gains") is better served by a regime-independent **breakeven-lock**
(floor stop at entry once high_water >= entry), which cannot place a stop through
market. Discuss before implementing.
